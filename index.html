        <h2>What is philmont?</h2>
        Philmont is an adventure where you go hiking with your friends to several different
        points of interest, including camps where you can stay and do activities on your way
        through the mountain. Your hike can either be easily done with several fun activities, 
        or really challenging where you have to climb up to the tallest peaks. But, me and my
        group are doing something inbetween.

        <h2>What are Me and my friends doing for philmont?</h2>
        me and my friends are going to philmont ourselves, going on a 64 mile treck through
        several different places with many activities to have as much fun as we can! Even
        though we have a decently long treck, im sure that there will be little to no difficulties
        with being able to keep everyone happy.
