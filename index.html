        <h2>What is philmont?</h2>
        Philmont is an adventure where you go hiking with your friends to several different
        points of interest, including camps where you can stay and do activities on your way
        through the mountain. Your hike can be easily done with several fun activities, 
        or challenging where you have to climb up to the tallest peaks. But, me and my
        group are doing something in between.

        <h2>What are Me and my friends doing for Philmont?</h2>
        Me and my friends are going to Philmont ourselves, from Jun 22 to July 6th, We are going on a 64-mile trek through
        several different places with many activities to have as much fun as we can! Even
        though we have a decently long track, I'm sure that there will be little to no difficulties
        with being able to keep everyone happy.

        <h2>What to Pack</h2>
        For Philmont, you should pack lots of stuff but mainly pack things that you think are 
        necessary because packing unnecessary stuff adds more weight to your bag, which makes
        it harder to go further due to how much weight you now have on you. I recommend that you at
        least get a few of these things: <br>
        Rain gear, Messkit with just a bowl and utensil, at least 3-5 changes to clothes, depending on
        how long your trip is, a flashlight, and at least 4 liters of water at all times, because you
        can usually fill up at staff camps. <br>
